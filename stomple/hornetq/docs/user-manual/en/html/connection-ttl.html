        deals with crashed clients and clients which have exited without cleanly closing their
        resources.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dead.connections"></a>17.1.&nbsp;Cleaning up Dead Connection Resources on the Server</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Before a HornetQ client application exits it is considered good practice that it
            should close its resources in a controlled manner, using a <tt class="literal">finally</tt>
            block.</p><p>Here's an example of a well behaved core client application closing its session and
            session factory in a finally block:</p><pre class="programlisting">
ClientSessionFactory sf = null;
ClientSession session = null;

try
{
   sf = HornetQClient.createClientSessionFactory(...);

   session = sf.createSession(...);
   
   ... do some stuff with the session...
}
finally
{
   if (session != null)
   {
      session.close();
   }
   
   if (sf != null)
   {
      sf.close();
   }
}
        </pre><p>And here's an example of a well behaved JMS client application:</p><pre class="programlisting">
Connection jmsConnection = null;

try
{
   ConnectionFactory jmsConnectionFactory = HornetQJMSClient.createConnectionFactory(...);

   jmsConnection = jmsConnectionFactory.createConnection();

   ... do some stuff with the connection...
}
finally
{
   if (connection != null)
   {
      connection.close();
   }
}
        </pre><p>Unfortunately users don't always write well behaved applications, and sometimes
            clients just crash so they don't have a chance to clean up their resources!</p><p>If this occurs then it can leave server side resources, like sessions, hanging on the
            server. If these were not removed they would cause a resource leak on the server and
            over time this result in the server running out of memory or other resources.</p><p>We have to balance the requirement for cleaning up dead client resources with the fact
            that sometimes the network between the client and the server can fail and then come
            back, allowing the client to reconnect. HornetQ supports client reconnection, so we
            don't want to clean up "dead" server side resources too soon or this will prevent any
            client from reconnecting, as it won't be able to find its old sessions on the
            server.</p><p>HornetQ makes all of this configurable. For each <tt class="literal">ClientSessionFactory</tt> we define a <span class="emphasis"><em>connection TTL</em></span>.
            Basically, the TTL determines how long the server will keep a connection alive in the
            absence of any data arriving from the client. The client will automatically send "ping"
            packets periodically to prevent the server from closing it down. If the server doesn't
            receive any packets on a connection for the connection TTL time, then it will
            automatically close all the sessions on the server that relate to that
            connection.</p><p>If you're using JMS, the connection TTL is defined by the <tt class="literal">ConnectionTTL</tt> attribute on a <tt class="literal">HornetQConnectionFactory</tt>
            instance, or if you're deploying JMS connection factory instances direct into JNDI on
            the server side, you can specify it in the xml config, using the parameter <tt class="literal">connection-ttl</tt>.</p><p>The default value for connection ttl is <tt class="literal">60000</tt>ms, i.e. 1 minute. A
            value of <tt class="literal">-1</tt> for <tt class="literal">ConnectionTTL</tt> means the server
            will never time out the connection on the server side.</p><p>If you do not wish clients to be able to specify their own connection TTL, you can
            override all values used by a global value set on the server side. This can be done by
            specifying the <tt class="literal">connection-ttl-override</tt> attribute in the server side
            configuration. The default value for <tt class="literal">connection-ttl-override</tt> is
                <tt class="literal">-1</tt> which means "do not override" (i.e. let clients use their own
            values).</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3476"></a>17.1.1.&nbsp;Closing core sessions or JMS connections that you have failed to close</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>As previously discussed, it's important that all core client sessions and JMS
                connections are always closed explicitly in a <tt class="literal">finally</tt> block when
                you are finished using them. </p><p>If you fail to do so, HornetQ will detect this at garbage collection time, and log
                a warning similar to the following in the logs (If you are using JMS the warning
                will involve a JMS connection not a client session):</p><pre class="programlisting">

            "dead" connection resources are cleaned up by the server. There's also another reason
            for pinging, and that's for the <span class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> to be able to detect that
            the server or network has failed.</p><p>As long as the client is receiving data from the server it will consider the
            connection to be still alive. </p><p>If the client does not receive any packets for <tt class="literal">client-failure-check-period</tt> milliseconds then it will consider the
            connection failed and will either initiate failover, or call any <tt class="literal">FailureListener</tt> instances (or <tt class="literal">ExceptionListener</tt>
            instances if you are using JMS) depending on how it has been configured.</p><p>If you're using JMS it's defined by the <tt class="literal">ClientFailureCheckPeriod</tt>
            attribute on a <tt class="literal">HornetQConnectionFactory</tt> instance, or if you're
            deploying JMS connection factory instances direct into JNDI on the server side, you can
            specify it in the <tt class="literal">hornetq-jms.xml </tt> configuration file, using the
            parameter <tt class="literal">client-failure-check-period</tt>.</p><p>The default value for client failure check period is <tt class="literal">30000</tt>ms, i.e.
            30 seconds. A value of <tt class="literal">-1</tt> means the client will never fail the
            connection on the client side if no data is received from the server. Typically this is
            much lower than connection TTL to allow clients to reconnect in case of transitory
            failure.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="connection-ttl.async-connection-execution"></a>17.3.&nbsp;Configuring Asynchronous Connection Execution</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>By default, packets received on the server side are executed on the remoting
            thread.</p><p>It is possible instead to use a thread from a thread pool to handle some packets so
            that the remoting thread is not tied up for too long. However, please note that
            processing operations asynchronously on another thread adds a little more latency.
            Please note that most short running operations are always handled on the remoting thread for performance reasons.
